### 3. (Required) WP < 6.0.3 - CSRF in wp-trackback.php

- [x] Summary: 
  - Vulnerability types: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Tested in version: 4.2
  - Fixed in version: 4.2.34
- [x] GIF Walkthrough (I didn't know how to EXACTLY recreate the attack but I gave an idea of how it works in the gif):

- [x] Steps to recreate:
1. Add a comment as a user with a link to a malicious site (or code; in this case, I used "wp-trackback.php") and make it seem like a legitimate website
2. Log in as an administrator and view the new comments on the "Comments" page
3. Click on the link to activate the CSRF attack (There is no check for CSRF attacks in the PHP code so a user can easily steal cookies and/or data (such as login information) from other users)
- [x] Affected source code:

### 4. (Optional) WordPress 2.8.1-4.7.2 - Control Characters in Redirect URL Validation

- [x] Summary: 
  - Vulnerability types: IDOR/URL Manipulation
  - Tested in version: 4.2
  - Fixed in version: 4.2.13
- [x] GIF Walkthrough:
![CodePath_Week_7_Lab_SS_4_IDOR_URL_Manipulation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111651054/197841736-68284336-7835-4fc9-b53e-57b2524b12cb.gif)
- [x] Steps to recreate: 
1. Post a public page as an administrator
2. Log out
3. As a user, manipulate the url to say "http://wpdistillery.vm/?author=1" and send the request
- The page will show a box with the author at the top. This allows for the attacker to get the author's username and use brute force (or another method) to obtain their password)
- [x] Affected source code:
  - [Link 1](http://wpdistillery.vm/?author=1) (Source Code)
  - [Link 2](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/288cd469396cfe7055972b457eb589cea51ce40e]

### 5. (Optional) PHP/Java code uploaded as an image (I couldn't find this on the list of vulnerabilities)
  
- [x] Summary: 
  - Vulnerability types: File Upload Attacks
  - Tested in version: 4.2
  - Fixed in version: N/A
- [x] GIF Walkthrough:

- [x] Steps to recreate:
1. Open the terminal and create a file called "*nameOfFile*.php.gif" and save it to your computer
2. Login to WordPress and go to "Media" -> "Add new"
3. Upload the "gif" file (the code will not recognize it as a PHP code)
- [x] Affected source code:
  - [Link 1](http://wpdistillery.vm/wp-admin/media-new.php) (Source Code)
